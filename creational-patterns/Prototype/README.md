# Prototype

The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that enables **the creation of objects based on an existing object**. Instead of creating new objects from scratch, a prototype object is used as a template to create new instances.

In this pattern, **a prototype object is created first, and then new instances are created by cloning the prototype object**. The cloning process creates a new object with the same properties and methods as the original prototype object. This enables the creation of new objects with minimal code, as the properties and methods of the prototype object are already defined.
