# Singleton - Implementation

General steps:

1. Create a **private static instance** variable of the class within the class itself.
2. Create a **public static method that acts as a global point of access** to the single instance of the class.
3. Use the public static method to access the single instance of the class throughout the application.
4. Make the **constructor of the class private** to prevent other classes from instantiating it directly.
5. Make the **copy constructor of the class private** to prevent other classes from copying the initialized singleton to a new singleton.
6. Make the **assignment operator of the class private** to prevent other classes from assigning the initialized singleton to a new singleton.

There are two types of Singleton design pattern:

1. **Eager Initialization** Singleton: In this approach, the instance of the Singleton class is **created at the time of class loading, rather than when it is first accessed**. This approach ensures that the Singleton instance is always available, but it can be memory-intensive if the Singleton class is not used frequently.
2. **Lazy Initialization** Singleton: In this approach, the Singleton instance is **created only when it is first accessed**. This approach conserves memory, but it can **lead to issues with concurrency** if multiple threads attempt to access the Singleton instance at the same time.

## Thread-safety issue in lazy initialization Singleton

```c++
// Thread 1
1 SingletonLazy* SingletonLazy::GetInstance() {
2  if(SingletonLazy::singleton_lazy_ == nullptr){
3    SingletonLazy::singleton_lazy_ = new SingletonLazy();
4  }
5  return SingletonLazy::singleton_lazy_;
6 }

// Thread 2
7 SingletonLazy* SingletonLazy::GetInstance() {
8   if(SingletonLazy::singleton_lazy_ == nullptr){
9     SingletonLazy::singleton_lazy_ = new SingletonLazy();
10  }
11  return SingletonLazy::singleton_lazy_;
12 }
```

Instruction flows leading to unsafety:

1. Thread 1 Line 1: `singleton_lazy_` is `nullptr` so Thread 1 Line 2 will be executed in the next cycle of Thread 1.
2. Thread 2 Line 1: Thread 2 preempts the CPU. `singleton_lazy_` is `nullptr` so Thread 2 Line 2 will be executed in the next cycle of Thread 2.
3. Thread 1 Line 2-5: Thread 1 creates a Singleton instance.
4. Thread 2 Line 2-5: Thread 2 creates another Singleton instance which breaks the singleton rule.

Solution: double-checked locking

```c++
SingletonThreadSafe* SingletonThreadSafe::GetInstance() {
  if(SingletonThreadSafe::singleton_thread_safe_ == nullptr) {
    mtx.lock();
    if (SingletonThreadSafe::singleton_thread_safe_ == nullptr) {
      SingletonThreadSafe::singleton_thread_safe_ = new SingletonThreadSafe();
    }
    mtx.unlock();
  }
  return SingletonThreadSafe::singleton_thread_safe_;
}
```

Nevertheless, the above solution is still not thread-safe. Instruction flows leading to unsafety:

```c++
SingletonThreadSafe* SingletonThreadSafe::GetInstance() {
  if(SingletonThreadSafe::singleton_thread_safe_ == nullptr) {
    mtx.lock();
    if (SingletonThreadSafe::singleton_thread_safe_ == nullptr) {
//      SingletonThreadSafe::singleton_thread_safe_ = new SingletonThreadSafe();
//      break down into low level instructions:
//        1. Allocate memory for SingletonThreadSafe instance
//        2. Call constructor of SingletonThreadSafe for initialization
//        3. Make singleton_thread_safe_ point to the allocated memory
    }
    mtx.unlock();
  }
  return SingletonThreadSafe::singleton_thread_safe_;
}
```

Step 2 and 3 are dependent on Step 1 but are independent of each other so that the compiler may swap the order of Step 2 and 3 for optimization. 

Consider the following scenario:

1. `singleton_thread_safe_` points to the allocated memory but the memory are not initialized in Thread 1.
2. Thread 2 preempts the CPU and return `singleton_thread_safe_` (since it is not `nullptr`).
3. The main thread preempts the CPU and access members of `SingletonThreadSafe` by dereference `singleton_thread_safe_`. However, the memory which `singleton_thread_safe_` is not initialized.

Solution: use `volatile`Â modifier to prevent compiler from reordering instructions associated with `singleton_thread_safe_`.
