# Factory

The factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In other words, the factory design pattern **defines an interface for creating objects, but delegates the responsibility of instantiation to subclasses**.

The main purpose of the factory design pattern is to provide a flexible way to create objects without coupling the code to specific classes or objects. Instead of creating objects directly in your code, **you use a factory class to create objects for you**. This makes your code more modular and easier to maintain, because **changes to the way objects are created can be made in the factory class without affecting the rest of the code**.

The factory design pattern is often used in situations where **the creation of an object is complex or requires some initialization**, or when the type of object that needs to be created may change depending on the context. It can also be useful when you want to **decouple the creation of an object from the code that uses it**, making your code more testable and easier to extend in the future.

# Use Cases

1. UI components: An Abstract Factory can be used to create families of related UI components, such as buttons, text boxes, and menus. This can ensure that the components have a consistent look and feel and are compatible with each other. ([GUI](./use-cases/GUI))
2. Database drivers: An Abstract Factory can be used to create families of related database drivers, such as JDBC drivers for different databases. This can ensure that the drivers have a consistent API and behavior, regardless of the underlying database.
3. Operating system APIs: An Abstract Factory can be used to create families of related operating system APIs, such as file system APIs, network APIs, and process APIs. This can ensure that the APIs have a consistent interface and behavior, regardless of the underlying operating system.
4. Encryption algorithms: An Abstract Factory can be used to create families of related encryption algorithms, such as symmetric encryption algorithms and asymmetric encryption algorithms. This can ensure that the algorithms are compatible with each other and have a consistent API.
5. Internationalization: An Abstract Factory can be used to create families of related objects for internationalization, such as resource bundles, date formatters, and number formatters. This can ensure that the objects are consistent across different languages and cultures.
