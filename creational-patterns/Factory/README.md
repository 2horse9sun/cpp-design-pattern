# Factory

The factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In other words, the factory design pattern **defines an interface for creating objects, but delegates the responsibility of instantiation to subclasses**.

The main purpose of the factory design pattern is to provide a flexible way to create objects without coupling the code to specific classes or objects. Instead of creating objects directly in your code, **you use a factory class to create objects for you**. This makes your code more modular and easier to maintain, because **changes to the way objects are created can be made in the factory class without affecting the rest of the code**.

The factory design pattern is often used in situations where **the creation of an object is complex or requires some initialization**, or when the type of object that needs to be created may change depending on the context. It can also be useful when you want to **decouple the creation of an object from the code that uses it**, making your code more testable and easier to extend in the future.
