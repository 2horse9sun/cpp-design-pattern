# Composite

The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single instance of an object. It composes objects into **tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies**.

The main idea behind the Composite pattern is to create a class hierarchy that consists of two types of objects: individual objects (leaf nodes) and composite objects (nodes that contain a group of objects, including leaf nodes and other composite nodes). This hierarchy forms a recursive tree-like structure, **where both leaf nodes and composite nodes share a common interface**.

# Use Cases

1. [File System](./use-cases/FileSystem): The Composite pattern is often used to represent a file system hierarchy. Each file or directory can be treated as a leaf node or a composite node, allowing you to perform operations on individual files or directories as well as on groups of files and directories.
2. GUI Components: GUI frameworks can utilize the Composite pattern to create complex user interfaces. Components such as panels, windows, buttons, and text fields can be treated as individual objects or composite objects, enabling the construction of nested UI structures.
3. Organization Hierarchy: The Composite pattern is suitable for modeling organization hierarchies, where an organization can consist of departments, teams, and individual employees. Each level of the hierarchy can be represented as a composite object, allowing for uniform treatment of the structure.
4. Graphics and Drawing: Drawing applications often use the Composite pattern to represent complex graphic objects. Basic shapes like lines, rectangles, and circles can be treated as leaf nodes, while more complex objects like diagrams or groups of shapes can be represented as composite nodes.
5. Menu Systems: In menu systems, the Composite pattern allows you to create nested menus and menu items. Individual menu items can be leaf nodes, while menus containing sub-menus or additional menu items can be composite nodes.
6. Project Management: The Composite pattern can be used to represent project structures, where a project can consist of sub-projects, tasks, and sub-tasks. This allows for hierarchical representation and uniform handling of the project components.
7. Document Structure: When dealing with documents, the Composite pattern can be utilized to represent the hierarchical structure of sections, subsections, paragraphs, and individual elements within a document. This enables uniform operations on the document's components.
