# Proxy

A proxy is a **wrapper or agent object** that is being called by the client to **access the real serving object behind the scenes**. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can **provide additional logic**. In the proxy, extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or **checking preconditions before operations** on the real object are invoked. For the client, usage of a proxy object is similar to using the real object, because both implement the same interface. (Wikipedia)
