# Visitor

The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It provides a way to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those objects.

The primary motivation behind the Visitor pattern is to achieve double dispatch, which means the method called depends on both the type of the visitor and the type of the element being visited. This allows you to define new operations on a group of related classes without modifying those classes.

# Use Cases

1. Serialization: Suppose you have a complex object structure that needs to be serialized into different formats (e.g., XML, JSON, binary). Instead of adding serialization logic to each class in the structure, you can use the Visitor pattern. You can define a visitor for each serialization format and implement the visit methods to perform the serialization operations on the objects.
2. GUI Components: In a graphical user interface (GUI) framework, you may have various GUI components such as buttons, labels, text boxes, etc. Each component may have different behavior when clicked or hovered. Instead of implementing these behaviors directly in each component class, you can use the Visitor pattern. Define a visitor for handling events (e.g., ClickVisitor) and implement the visit methods for each GUI component to perform the desired action when the visitor is accepted.
3. Code Analysis and Transformation: In a code analysis or transformation tool, you may need to traverse and analyze an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing source code. The Visitor pattern can be used to separate the analysis or transformation logic from the AST classes. You can define visitors for various analysis tasks (e.g., finding code smells, detecting security vulnerabilities) or code transformations (e.g., refactoring, code generation) and implement the visit methods to perform the desired operations on the AST nodes.
4. Database Operations: When working with a database, you may have different types of database entities (e.g., tables, views, stored procedures). You can use the Visitor pattern to perform operations such as querying, updating, or deleting on these entities. Define visitors for each database operation and implement the visit methods to execute the respective database operations on the entities.
5. [Document Processing](./use-cases/Document): In a document processing system, you may have different types of documents (e.g., PDF, Word, HTML). Instead of adding document processing logic directly to each document class, you can use the Visitor pattern. Define visitors for different document processing tasks (e.g., extracting text, applying formatting, generating summaries) and implement the visit methods to perform the respective operations on the documents.
6. Compiler Optimizations: In a compiler, you may have multiple optimization passes to improve the performance of the generated code. The Visitor pattern can be used to separate the optimizations from the code generation logic. You can define visitors for each optimization pass and implement the visit methods to perform the necessary code transformations and optimizations on the AST or intermediate representation.
