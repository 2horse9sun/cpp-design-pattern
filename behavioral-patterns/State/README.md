# State

The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that **allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes**. It is useful when you have an object that needs to change its behavior based on its internal state, and you want to avoid using large conditional statements to handle all the possible states.

The main idea behind the State pattern is to **encapsulate the different states of an object into separate classes**, each representing a specific state, and **define a common interface or base class that all state classes implement**. This interface typically includes methods that represent the actions or operations that can be performed on the object.

# Use Cases

1. User interface and form validation: In user interfaces, you often encounter forms that have different validation rules and behaviors based on the current state. By using the State pattern, you can encapsulate the validation logic for each state in separate classes, allowing the form to change its behavior dynamically as the user interacts with it.
2. Game development: Games often have characters or game objects with different behaviors based on their current state, such as idle, walking, running, attacking, or jumping. By using the State pattern, you can define separate state classes for each behavior, making it easier to manage and transition between different states based on game events or player input.
3. Workflow or process management: When dealing with complex workflows or processes, different actions and behaviors may be required depending on the current stage or state of the process. The State pattern can help in encapsulating the behavior associated with each state, making it easier to define and manage the transitions between different stages.
4. [Network communication protocols](./use-cases/NetworkConnection): In network protocols, the behavior of a network entity can change based on the state of the communication. For example, a network connection may have states such as connected, disconnected, or waiting for a response. Using the State pattern, you can model each state as a separate class and define the behavior associated with that state, allowing for easier management of network communication.
5. Traffic light control system: A traffic light system can have different states such as green, yellow, and red. Each state has its own behavior and duration. By using the State pattern, you can model each state as a separate class and define the actions and transitions associated with each state, allowing for a flexible and maintainable implementation of the traffic light control system.
