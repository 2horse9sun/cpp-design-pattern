# Memento

The Memento design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. It is used to provide the ability to save and restore an object's state, effectively allowing you to **undo or roll back changes made to the object**.

# Use Cases

1. Text Editors or Document Processing: Text editors often provide undo and redo functionality to revert or redo changes made to a document. The Memento pattern can be used to capture and store the document's state at different points in time, allowing users to undo or redo their actions.
2. Configuration Management: In applications that involve complex configurations or settings, the Memento pattern can be used to save and restore the state of configurations. This can be helpful in scenarios where users want to revert back to a previous configuration or switch between different configurations.
3. [Transaction Management](./use-cases/Transaction): In database systems or financial applications, the Memento pattern can be used to implement transactional behavior. It enables you to save the state of a transaction before making changes to the system and roll back to the saved state if the transaction fails or is canceled.
4. Game Development: Games often require the ability to save and load game states or implement undo and redo functionality. The Memento pattern can be used to capture the state of game objects, such as player positions, scores, and game progress, allowing players to save and restore their game state.
5. Workflow or Process Management: Applications that involve complex workflows or processes can benefit from the Memento pattern. It can be used to save intermediate states or checkpoints during the execution of a workflow, enabling users to roll back to a specific point or resume from a previous state.
6. Collaborative Editing: In collaborative environments where multiple users can make changes to shared resources, the Memento pattern can be used to capture and restore the state of the shared resource. It allows users to revert back to previous versions or undo changes made by other collaborators.
