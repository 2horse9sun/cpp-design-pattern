# Chain of Responsibility 

The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to **pass a request along a chain of potential handlers** until one of them handles the request. It **decouples senders and receivers of a request**, giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request independently.

In this pattern, each handler contains a reference to the next handler in the chain. When a request is made, it's passed to the first handler in the chain. If the handler can handle the request, it does so and the process stops. If the handler can't handle the request, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain, and so on, until a handler is found that can handle the request or until the end of the chain is reached.

# Use Cases

1. Request processing pipelines: In systems where requests pass through a series of processing steps, such as data validation, authentication, authorization, and logging, the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be applied. Each step in the pipeline becomes a handler in the chain, responsible for performing its specific processing task. This allows for easy modification and reordering of the pipeline without affecting the overall structure.
2. Event handling: When dealing with events or notifications, the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to handle different types of events in a hierarchical manner. Each handler in the chain represents a specific event handler that processes or reacts to the event. If a handler can't handle the event, it passes it to the next handler in the chain, providing a cascading effect.
3. Error handling: Error handling can benefit from the Chain of Responsibility pattern. Instead of having a single error handler responsible for all types of errors, you can create a chain of error handlers, each specialized in handling a specific type of error. When an error occurs, it traverses the chain until a suitable handler is found. This allows for granular and specific error handling based on the nature of the error.
4. Logging and auditing: When logging or auditing actions in a system, the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be employed to handle different levels or types of log entries. Each handler in the chain can represent a different level of logging or a specific type of log entry. This approach allows for modular and configurable logging, where each handler can decide whether to log, modify, or discard the log entry.
5. [Middleware](./use-cases/Middleware) in web frameworks: Web frameworks often use the Chain of Responsibility pattern to implement middleware components. Each middleware in the chain performs a specific operation, such as authentication, request parsing, caching, or error handling. The request passes through the chain of middleware, allowing each component to process or modify it before reaching the final handler.
