# Template Method

The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that **defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure**. It promotes code reuse and provides a way to define a common algorithm structure while allowing flexibility in certain implementation details.

The main idea behind the Template Method pattern is to encapsulate the invariant parts of an algorithm in a base class, while allowing the variable parts to be implemented in derived classes. The base class provides a template method that defines the overall algorithm structure by calling various abstract or hook methods. Subclasses then provide their own implementations of these methods to customize the algorithm's behavior.

# Use Cases

1. Web Frameworks: Web frameworks often use the Template Method pattern to define the structure of web pages or components. The framework provides a base class or template that outlines the overall structure of a web page, with specific methods for rendering headers, footers, and content sections. Subclasses can then extend the template and provide their own implementations for rendering specific content, such as blog posts, product listings, or user profiles.
2. Data Processing Pipelines: When dealing with data processing pipelines, the Template Method pattern can be useful. The base class can define the steps for reading data from a source, performing transformations or calculations, and writing the processed data to a destination. Subclasses can then specialize in implementing the specific logic for each step, such as reading data from a file, performing data cleansing, and storing the results in a database.
3. Automated Testing: In automated testing frameworks, the Template Method pattern can be applied to define a common structure for test cases. The base class can provide a template method that outlines the sequence of actions to be performed during a test, such as setting up test data, executing the test steps, and verifying the expected results. Subclasses can then override specific steps or provide custom assertions based on the requirements of each individual test case.
4. Document Generation: Template Method pattern can be used in document generation scenarios, where you have a common structure for generating different types of documents. The base class can define the skeleton of the document, with methods for adding headers, footers, and sections. Subclasses can then provide their own implementations for populating the content of each section based on the type of document being generated, such as reports, invoices, or contracts.
5. Game Development: In game development, the Template Method pattern can be used to define the structure of gameplay algorithms. The base class can provide a template for game levels or scenarios, with methods for initializing the game state, updating game objects, handling user input, and rendering the game graphics. Subclasses can then specialize in implementing the specific behavior and rules for each level or scenario.
