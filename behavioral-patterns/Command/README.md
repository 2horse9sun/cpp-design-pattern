# Command

The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that **encapsulates a request as an object**, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. It promotes loose coupling between the sender of a request and its receiver by decoupling the sender from the concrete class that performs the requested action.

# Use Cases

1. GUI operations: In graphical user interface applications, commands can be used to represent various user actions, such as button clicks, menu selections, or keyboard shortcuts. Each command encapsulates the action and can be executed or undone as needed.
2. Transactional systems: Command objects can be used to represent individual operations within a transaction. By encapsulating each operation as a command, you can easily manage the execution, rollback, and recovery of a transaction.
3. Multi-level undo/redo functionality: The Command pattern is well-suited for implementing undo/redo functionality. Each executed command can be stored in a history stack, allowing users to undo or redo actions sequentially.
4. Job queues: Commands can be used to represent jobs or tasks within a queue. Each command encapsulates a specific task to be executed asynchronously or in a [separate thread](./use-cases/Multithreading). The queue can be managed by an invoker, which retrieves commands from the queue and executes them.
5. Logging and auditing: Commands provide a convenient way to log or audit actions within a system. By representing each action as a command, you can easily capture and store the necessary information for auditing purposes or system monitoring.
6. Macro recording and playback: The Command pattern can be used to record a sequence of user actions and replay them later. Each user action is represented as a command, which can be stored and executed sequentially to reproduce the recorded behavior.
7. Remote method invocation: In distributed systems, commands can be used to encapsulate requests and send them across the network for remote method invocation. The receiver on the remote side executes the command and sends back the result or status.
